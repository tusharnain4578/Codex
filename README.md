# Codex
It's a MERN project of a web app which runs programs of few languages.

This app includes :-

1. User Authentication using JWT Tokens
2. Powerfull code editor i.e, Ace Js
3. And the most important is the API for code compiling, which i made for only windows commandline, it means the backend can only work on windows machine with all the programming languages installed on it.

The code compiler API i made, is only for windows, but you can easily convert that into your server os if you have knowledge of NodeJs and your operating system's command line. Just have to change the commands and make sure to install all the compilers of the programming language you provides.

It was not possible for me to deploy this project on some online servers like heroku, netlify, etc. because the code compiler API cannot work there.
